Issue,"High, Medium",Critical,CRITICAL: Priority Overlap between 'High' and 'Medium' rules regarding study phases and data types.,,,
Issue,"Low, Medium, High",Warning,WARNING: 'Low' priority rule is too broad and may capture abstracts that should be classified as Medium or High if not processed strictly in order.,,,
Issue,"Relevance, High, Medium, Low",Warning,"WARNING: Keyword specificity risk. Some CLIENT KEYWORDS (e.g., 'Phosphate binder', 'Phosphate') are generic and may cause false positives if not paired with context.",,,
Optimization,High,,,"Phase 2 data, Phase 3 data (including meta-analyses), real-world data (including PROs and registry data), Phosphate binders/phosphate lowering treatment","Phase 2 data, Phase 3 data (including meta-analyses), real-world data (including PROs and registry data), Phosphate binders/phosphate lowering treatment (excluding studies only describing trial design, endpoints, or preclinical data without results)","Clarifies that High Priority is reserved for studies with substantive results, not just design or endpoints, reducing overlap with Medium."
Optimization,Medium,,,"Phase 1 data, retrospective analyses, prognostic studies, trial designs, preclinical studies; studies with trial outcomes and endpoints; other general studies","Phase 1 data, retrospective analyses, prognostic studies, trial designs, preclinical studies; studies with trial outcomes and endpoints (excluding Phase 2/3, real-world data, and phosphate binder treatments as defined in High Priority); other general studies",Explicitly excludes High Priority criteria to enforce mutual exclusivity.
Optimization,Low,,,All abstracts that only have mention of an indication and does not include any other data,"All abstracts that only mention an indication and do not include any study data, outcomes, endpoints, or treatments as defined in higher priorities",Prevents Low Priority from capturing abstracts that should be classified as Medium or High.
Optimization,Relevance,,,All abstracts that have client provided keywords,All abstracts that have client provided keywords (ensure keywords are matched in relevant clinical or scientific context to avoid false positives),Improves keyword accuracy and reduces risk of irrelevant matches.
